# Test Post

This is a test post written in English. This demonstrates how the multilingual setup works with file extensions.

## Features

- Written in English
- Uses `.md` extension
- Will be automatically translated when you create `.tr.md` version

## How it works

1. Create your main post as `filename.md`
2. Create translations as `filename.tr.md`, `filename.fr.md`, etc.
3. Hugo automatically handles the language switching
